    I am Kalyanram Poonamalli, currently pursuing my 3rd year B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering at SRM University, AP. I was born in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India. I have always been passionate about{" "}
    <span className="text-white dark:bg-orange-700/35 bg-orange-700/75 px-2 font-mono rounded">
      technology
    </span>
    , which led me to choose Computer Science as my career path.  
    <br />
    <br />
    Since my 1st year, I have explored various fields like{" "}
    <span className="text-white dark:bg-orange-700/35 bg-orange-700/75 px-2 font-mono rounded">
      web development
    </span>
    ,{" "}
    <span className="text-white dark:bg-orange-700/35 bg-orange-700/75 px-2 font-mono rounded">
      game development
    </span>
    ,{" "}
    <span className="text-white dark:bg-orange-700/35 bg-orange-700/75 px-2 font-mono rounded">
      cybersecurity
    </span>
    , and{" "}
    <span className="text-white dark:bg-orange-700/35 bg-orange-700/75 px-2 font-mono rounded">
      blockchain
    </span>
    . Among these, game development stood out the most, as my childhood dream has always been to create my own games.  
    <br />
    <br />
    At my university, we are fortunate to have a student-run research and development lab called{" "}
    <span className="text-white dark:bg-orange-700/35 bg-orange-700/75 px-2 font-mono rounded">
      Next Tech Lab
    </span>
    , which includes a sub-lab,{" "}
    <span className="text-white dark:bg-orange-700/35 bg-orange-700/75 px-2 font-mono rounded">
      Pausch Lab
    </span>
    , dedicated to game development and human-computer interaction. I was selected into Pausch Lab, where, under the guidance of my seniors, I explored{" "}
    <span className="text-white dark:bg-orange-700/35 bg-orange-700/75 px-2 font-mono rounded">
      2D and 3D game development
    </span>
    using{" "}
    <span className="text-white dark:bg-orange-700/35 bg-orange-700/75 px-2 font-mono rounded">
      Unity

    <span className="text-white dark:bg-orange-700/35 bg-orange-700/75 px-2 font-mono rounded">
      Unreal Engine
    </span>
    . Later, I also explored{" "}
    <span className="text-white dark:bg-orange-700/35 bg-orange-700/75 px-2 font-mono rounded">
      AR and VR technologies
    </span>
    . Over time, I was promoted from an associate to a member, and now I serve as a{" "}
    <span className="text-white dark:bg-orange-700/35 bg-orange-700/75 px-2 font-mono rounded">
      board member
    </span>{" "}
    of the Pausch Lab.  
    <br />
    <br />
    More recently, I have started focusing on{" "}
    <span className="text-white dark:bg-orange-700/35 bg-orange-700/75 px-2 font-mono rounded">
      web development
    </span>{" "}
    as my mainstream career path. I have learned the fundamentals of{" "}
